# Step 1: Ask
It’s impossible to solve a problem if you don’t know what it is. These are some things to consider:

Define the problem you’re trying to solve 
    #### The Problem?
    * HACCP LOGS ARE NOT BEING FULLY COMPLETED
    * NOT ENOUGH SPACE IN BINDERS & MANAGERS ARE NOT SIGNING WEEKLY LOGS

Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations

Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions

Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication

Take a step back and see the whole situation in context

Questions to ask yourself in this step: 
What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?

Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?


# Step 2: Prepare 
You will decide what data you need to collect in order to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it is useful. You might use your business task to decide: 

What metrics to measure

Locate data in your database

Create security measures to protect that data

Questions to ask yourself in this step: 
What do I need to figure out how to solve this problem?

What research do I need to do?
